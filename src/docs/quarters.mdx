Quarters extends the functionality of towns and plots to allow the creation of apartments. Standard [plots](https://earthmc.net/docs/town#plots) are restricted to a simple grid-based system that requires allowing and restricting permissions of an entire chunk. Quarters can instead create dynamically sized cuboids in which permissions can be edited.

## Creating a Quarter

To create a quarter you need to be the mayor or councillor, then you can select two positions using a flint item. With two positions selected an outline of a cuboid will appear showing your selection while you are holding the wand item. To proceed type `/q selection add`, if you would like to add more cuboids to your selection repeat selecting two positions and adding them with the same command.

:::tip

If you cannot get access to a flint you can use `/q pos1` and `/q pos2` to select at your feet.

:::

With your cuboids selected run the command `/q create`, if you have the necessary permissions this will turn all your selected cuboids into a quarter. These cuboids will all share a particle outline and permissions.

Remain aware that any cuboids added will be validated before creation to ensure that they are in a valid location. If you are having issues with creating a new quarter check the below:

- The quarter is entirely within a single town
- There is no wilderness within any of the cuboid's bounds
- Your selected cuboids do not overlap with any pre-existing cuboids

## Permission Management

To sell a quarter stand within its bounds and type `/q sell {price}`, a player can then purchase it using `/q claim` while standing inside it. The owner of a quarter can add people they trust to share perms with them using `/q trust add {username}`. By default quarters will be of the "apartment" type, the most basic type. Read below for more on quarter types.

You must first turn the quarter into an embassy using `/q toggle embassy` to sell to a player who is not a resident of the quarter's town. If the quarter's embassy status is removed the non-resident owner's ownership will be revoked.

:::warning

Quarter permissions override the underlying plot permissions.

## Quarter Types

All quarter types are additive to the functionality of the default apartment type, below is a short description of the others.

### Commons

Allows for any resident in the quarter's town to switch and itemuse within the quarter's bounds, this can be extended to any player by turning the quarter into an embassy using `/q toggle embassy`.

### Shop

The shop type allows the creation of shops independent of the underlying plot's shop status.

### Station

Station type quarters allow residents of the quarter's town to place, use and destroy boats and minecarts within the quarter's bounds. Similarly to the commons quarter type this can be extended to any player regardless of their town affiliation using `/q toggle embassy`.

## Commands

:::tip Premium colour feature

Players with [Premium](https://earthmc.net/docs/premium) can change quarter particle outline colour with `/q colour {r} {g} {b}`. RGB takes in three int values between 0-255.
